# InventoryProject

Project built for [Udacity's Android Basics Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803).

_There was an additional chapter about Database, Content Providers and Cursor Loader. It has been removed from the current program. 
This project was the final project of the degree._

Android app made to help an imaginary fruit vendor with its inventory. The user can keep track of the fruit stocks and call suppliers if necessary.


## Features
* Store information in a SQLite database.
* Update the database based on user input (edit product details, delete product).
* Fetch database information using a Content Provider.
* Input error check before validating entry in database (a toast warns the user about the missing information).
* Contact the supplier with an Intent to a phone app, using the Supplier Phone Number stored in the database. 

_Database and content provider libraries were not allowed for this project._
